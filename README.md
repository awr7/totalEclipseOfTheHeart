# Total Eclipse of the Heart

## About
In the spirit of fun and curiosity, I embarked on a rapid development challenge to create a web app visualizing the path of the solar eclipse. Motivated by today's solar eclipse buzz, I wanted to see what I could build in just 24 minutes.

## Motivation
The solar eclipse is a phenomenon that captures the attention of many. With the eclipse happening today, I decided to challenge myself to create something both educational and engaging in a very short amount of time. This project is not meant to be taken too seriously; it's more about the journey and the fun of coding under time constraints.

## Result
In 24 minutes, leveraging NASA's dataset, I managed to craft a basic yet functional web app that tracks the solar eclipse's path. The tool allows users to view the eclipse's progression over time on a map, adjusting to different time zones.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Geopandas
- PyDeck
- Pandas

Check out the live app and see how a quick coding session turned into a tool that tracks one of nature's most fascinating events!
