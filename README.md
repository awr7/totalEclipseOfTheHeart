# Solar Eclipse Path Visualizer

## About
During all the solar eclipse hype, I decided to time myself tos ee how long it would take me to recreate the NASA eclipse explorer map. All in all it only took me 24 minutes to create this web app and I'm happy of the way it turned out. Big thanks to NASA for having public datasets and huge thanks to streamlit for being so lightweightin simple allowing me to develop and deploy this application at lightning speeds.

## How to Run
Either go to the live website https://solar-eclipse.streamlit.app/ or clone the git repository and install all the dependencies in requirements.txt then run the command streamlit run app.py.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Geopandas
- PyDeck
- Pandas

Check out the live app and see how a quick coding session turned into a tool that tracks one of nature's most fascinating events!
